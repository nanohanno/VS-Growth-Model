# VS-Growth-Model
Python code for the calculation of GaAs nanowire diameters during growth by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The code was used for the calculations published in KÃ¼pers et al. Nano Res. (2018) 11: 2885. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12274-018-1984-1

The basic parameters are:
eta : The form factor given in Tersoff's model
R : The effective flux ratio from Tersoff's model
L : The adatom diffusion length in nm
tg : The growth time in min
vsr : Effective vapour-solid growth rate in nm/min
ax : Axial growth rate in nm/min
